Thank you for purchasing Simple Trigger!

Get Started:
---------------

1) Go to the upper toolbar and location the Simple Trigger section via "Tools->SimpleTrigger->CreateTrigger".
   This will create a SimpleTrigger for you.  You may also drag and drop the already-created SimpleTrigger prefab,
   which is exactly the same thing, except in prefab form.

2) Choose what the trigger will do once activated via the "Action" property.

3) Corresponding to your action that you've chosen, you can set the properties to be used during the action via
   the other properties below the "Action" property (Action Integer, Action String, etc.)
   
4) Set the "Affected GameObject" property to the recipient GameObject which receives the action.

   PLEASE NOTE: Not all actions may use this property, just as some actions may not use all of the
   extra properties for the action as noted in the previous step!
   
5) Set the "Triggering GameObject" to the GameObject the is allowed to trigger the GameObject.  This may be set
   as empty if any GameObject should be allowed to activate the trigger.
   
6) On last step, you can set the "Trigger Only Once" option to only run the action once on the initial activation
   of the trigger.
   
   Congrats!  You've created you're very first Simple Trigger!
