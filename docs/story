A story proposition: 

Every X years, a new core must be placed into the tower for maintaining the life and energy level in the curcuit world. To do this, an old veteran repair bot B4 is given the assignment of finding a new core, evaluate whether it is fit to be a new core, and then bring it to the tower to attach it. 

This process gets interupted by an accident that destroys one of the many towers, which forces the awakening of B4 much more early that normal. B4 encounters MiMi from the destroyed tower, and establishes the repair bond, signifying that the path of the chosen has begun. 

Normally, the path to be a new core, requires overcoming several obstacles, puzzles to test whether you are fit to be the chosen core, but the accident have also released an ancient virus, which is now roaming the curcuit world and drawing power for each time MiMi and B4 enpowers objects. 

Ultimately they fight this virus which has manifested the core of the tower, and wins. Then... 

Practical: 
- The virus makes its first real appearance in level one, infesting the tower in the background.
- The virus begins manipulating and infecting (top-down approach) the puzzles B4 MiMi in hostile ways. 
- The virus affects the AI helpers to selfdestruct, or assist it to caputre MiMi 

- rest... tba.
